# Step 5: Setting up the Databricks configuration 
The total distance and baseline premium is sent to Databricks for ML prediction. For ease of purposes, we’ve included the [API call](pipeline_unirest.js) that easily allows you to connect to your ML model. Although we’ve decided to use Databricks, you are free to use any ML platform of your choice. 

In [Step 6](Prediction.md), we will write the ML prediction to MongoDB.
