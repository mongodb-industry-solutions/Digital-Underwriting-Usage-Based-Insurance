# Digital-Underwriting: Usage-Based-Insurance

Underwriting is a critical aspect of insurance companies, and its efficiency plays a major role in the company’s profitability and success. MongoDB helps to streamline the underwriting process by providing a flexible and scalable database solution for storing and processing vast amounts of real-time data. 

In this GitHub repository, we will demonstrate how to utilize MongoDB to build an automated underwriting process to calculate a new premium for a connected car. By using the sample customer “Eddie Grant”, we will show how easy the process is of calculating a data-driven insurance premium with MongoDB and Databricks, as seen in Figure 1.
